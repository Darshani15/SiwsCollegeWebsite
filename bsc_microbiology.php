            <h2>About the Department of Microbiology</h2>
            <p>Microbiology as a science has expanded by leaps and bounds in the past few decades. The scope of the subject is huge because of the involvement of Microbiology in various fields like Pharmacy, Medicine, Clinical Research, Dairy industry, Beverage industry, Sewage treatment, Nanotechnology, Environmental science, Space technology, etc. At present, the scientific, analytical, and problem-solving skills developed by Microbiology graduates are in great demand in the corporate sector. This wide applicability shows the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, which fits well with the broad and flexible learning approach encouraged by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.</p>

            <p>The Department of Microbiology at S.I.W.S. College focuses on nurturing students to fulfill the demand of the local and global job market. To support and enhance learning abilities, the department houses a library comprising of books and e-books related to the subject contributed by faculty members and alumni. Students are provided with hands-on training in bioinformatics and ICT tools using internet-enabled computer facilities available in the department.</p>

            <p>The department emphasizes both academic excellence and personal development through regular counselling, mentoring, and skill-building activities. Students are actively encouraged to participate in the MicrobiOlympiad, a state-level competition featuring quizzes, poster presentations, and essay writing to stimulate scientific curiosity and creativity. The department organizes an annual intercollegiate learning with fun fest ‘MICROBIA’ which is conducted in a hybrid mode and includes competitions and games with microbiological themes.</p>

            <p>The department regularly conducts water quality analysis of various water sources in the campus. This practice not only ensures water safety on campus but also helps students gain hands-on experience in environmental monitoring and public health microbiology. The department actively promotes eco-friendly waste management through biocomposting. Organic waste generated from the campus canteen and garden is collected and processed in composting units. Students are involved in the maintenance of the compost pit.</p>

            <p>Short-term certificate courses are designed and delivered to the students in every semester to bridge gaps in subject knowledge acquired through various verticals under NEP 2020. Expert lectures are organized to supplement subject knowledge as well as to equip students with the scope of the subject and become future-ready. With a strong focus on holistic development, the department is committed to shaping students into knowledgeable, skilled, and responsible microbiologists of tomorrow.</p>

            <p>The faculty of the department are invited as BOS members, examiners, and moderators to other colleges. They are actively involved in syllabus framing at institutional and University both at UG and PG levels. All faculty members are life members of Microbiologist Society, India. The faculty members are involved in research, with publications in peer-reviewed journals, presented research papers at national and international conferences, and also won awards for the same. The department also has the credit of taking up minor research projects funded by the University of Mumbai.</p>
